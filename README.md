# fantasy-football
#### I wanted to try and predict whether or not a football player would meet or exceed their fantasy football projection.
#### To do this, I cleaned and combined 2 data sets that had different statistics on NFL players from the 2019 season and also calculated additional statistics.
#### I started small by calculating for one player (Patrick Mahomes) and then proceeded to make a larger pandas dataframe for all the players.
#### Finally, I created various sci-kit learn models including a decision tree and a random forest and applied them to the dataframe as a whole, and then to the dataframe by position (QB, RB, WR, TE).
